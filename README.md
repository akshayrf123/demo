## Recommendation System

## Sentiment Analysis using NLP techniques and Classification of Restaurants using predictive Modelling

Used NLP techniques on review to calculate the sentiment and combined along with other features on the popular yelp data set to classify the restaurants.

## Time Series Forecasting

Forecasted the number of rentals of bikes with time based on external attributes like Temperature, wind speed and humidity. A study was also made on if the bike renting services are in greater demand during weekends. Used ACF, PACF plots, Spectral Analysis and Visual Decomposition techniques to check for seasonality in the
variables. Rental count was forecasted using ARIMA,SARIMA, SARIMAX.
